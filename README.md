## Getting started
To start using Boxinator, you will need to download the exe file on your computer (Windows). Once installed, you can open the software and begin creating your first annoation project in the "New" tab. Here you fill in the following boxes and chose between video mode or image mode based on your situation. The category file is of type .txt and each row in this file is a new category e.g. car.

## Annotation

* Open the annotation tool and select the category you want to use from the combobox at the top of the screen.

* In the annotation window, click and hold the left mouse button to draw a box around the object you want to label. Release the mouse button to finish drawing the box.

* To edit a box, mark the "selection mode" box, then click and hold the left mouse button on the box to move or resize the box.

* To delete a box, select it and press the delete key on your keyboard.

* To mark a frame as a keyframe, select the keyframe button. This defines the starting and ending points of a smooth transition

* all frames between keyframes are automatically interpolated, which means that all the boxes in the keyframe will be copied to all frames between keyframes.

* Once you have labeled all the objects in a frame, you can move on to the next frame and repeat the process.
